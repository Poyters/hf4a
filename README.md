# High Frontier 4 All board game Save Sheets

I'm a board gamer too, and I know how frustrating it can be to not have enough time to play your favorite game. That's why I came up with the idea to create online signups for the High Frontier 4 All board game.

I tried to make the save process as fast as possible. As a result, saving sessions should not take more than 30 seconds per player and 30 seconds for the Game&Map state (e.g. 2 minutes for a 3-player game).
